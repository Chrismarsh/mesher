# mesher

Mesher is a novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software that allows mesh generation to be generated from an arbitrary number of hydrologically important features while maintaining a variable spatial resolution. Triangle quality is guaranteed as well as a smooth graduation from small to large triangles. Including these additional features resulted in a better representation of spatial heterogeneity versus classic topography-only mesh generation. The paper describing *mesher* can be [found here](https://www.usask.ca/hydrology-old/papers/Marsh,_et_al_2018.pdf).
