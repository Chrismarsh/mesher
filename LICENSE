GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
   the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
   share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
   software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
   GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
   any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
   your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
   price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
   have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
	   them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
   want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
   free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
   these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
   certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
   you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
   gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
   freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
   or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
   know their rights.

   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
   (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
   giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
   that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
   authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
   changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
   authors of previous versions.

   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
   modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
   can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
   protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
   pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
   use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
   have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
   products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
   stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
   of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.

   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
   States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
   software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
   avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
   make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
   patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
   modification follow.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
   works, such as semiconductor masks.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
   exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
   earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
    to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
    tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
	    extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
    work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
    the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
    menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

    1. Source Code.

    The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
    for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
    form of a work.

    A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
    standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
    interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
    is widely used among developers working in that language.

    The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
    than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
    packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
    Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
    Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
    implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
    "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
    (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
    (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
    produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

    The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
    the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
	    work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
    control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
    System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
    programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
    which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
    includes interface definition files associated with source files for
    the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
    linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
    such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
    subprograms and other parts of the work.

    The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
    can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
    Source.

    The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
    same work.

    2. Basic Permissions.

    All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
    copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
    conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
    permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
    covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
    content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
    rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

    You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
    convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
    in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
    of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
    with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
    the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
    not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
    for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
    and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
    your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

    Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
    the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
    makes it unnecessary.

    3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

    No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
    measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
    11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
    similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
    measures.

    When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
    circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
    is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
    the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
    modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
    users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
    technological measures.

    4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

    You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
    receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
    appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
    keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
    non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
    keep intact all notices of thecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

    You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you conveyof the aggregate.

    6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

    You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
    of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
    machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
    in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmisu received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    deth subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering o cess from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), an soffer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in thlusame way through the same place at no
    further charge.  Yootneed not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Souode along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the oibect code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
mailbe on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    r  that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you mauctain
    clear directions next to the object code saying wherfar hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisofnsure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satiscu these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peeusto-peer transmisu received the object code with such an offer
    iin accord
    deth subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object cbse by offering o cess from a designated
    place (gratis or fuc a charge), an soffer equivalent access to the
    Corresponducg Source in thlusame way through the same place at no
    fur mer charge.  Yootneed not require recipients to copy the
    Creresponding Souode along with the object code.  If the place two    copy the oibect code is a network server, the Correspondipo Source
mailbe on a different server (operated by you or e third party)
    r  that supports equivalent copying facilities,serovided you mauctain
    clear directions next to the object  bde saying wherfar hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remtin obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long asndeeded to satisofnsure that it is
    available for as long asigeeded to satiscu these requirements.

    e) Convey the objeco  such an offer
    iin accord
    deth subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object cbse by offering o cess from a designated
    plcey the object cbse by offering o cess from a destional Terms.

    "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
    License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
    Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
    be treated as though they were of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of ense document contains
    a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
    License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
    of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
    not survive such relicensing or conveying.

    If you add terms to a covered work ineans
    prior to 60 days after the cessation.

    Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
    reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
    violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
    received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
    copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
    your receipt of the notice.

    Termination of your rights undriginal licensors, to run, modify and
    propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
    for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

    An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
    organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
    organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered

    work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

    A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
    owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
    hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
    by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
    but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
    consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
    purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
    patent sublicenses in a g Source to be so
    available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
    patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
    consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
    license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
    actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
    covered workent
    to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
    the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
    parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
    patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
    conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
    for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
    contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
    or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

    Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
    any implied license or oc License into a single
    combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
    License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
    but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
    section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
    combinationoose that version for the Program.

    Later license versions may give you additional or different
    permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
    author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
    later version.
