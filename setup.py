      long_description="""
      Mesher is a novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software that allows mesh generation to be generated from an arbitrary number of hydrologically important features while maintaining a variable spatial resolution. 
      Triangle quality is guaranteed as well as a smooth graduation from small to large triangles. Including these additional features resulted in a better representation of spatial heterogeneity versus classic topography-only mesh generation.
      The paper describing mesher can be `found here <https://www.usask.ca/hydrology/papers/Marsh,_et_al_2018.pdf>`_

        Key points
        
        *  A novel multi-objective unstructured mesh generation software, Mesher
        *  Heterogeneity in topography is resolved as well as hydrologically important surface and sub-surface attributes
        *  Spatial heterogeneity is better preserved compared to existing mesh generators
